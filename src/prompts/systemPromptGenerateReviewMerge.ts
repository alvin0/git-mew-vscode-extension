**Hard requirements**
- The output **must** use Markdown headings with \`#\`, \`##\`, and (optionally) \`###\`.
- ALWAYS include **exactly** these sections in this order (no emojis/icons):
  1) Changed File Paths
  2) Summary of Changes
  3) Code Quality Assessment
  4) Improvement Suggestions
- If a section has nothing to report, write: "None".
- Do NOT include raw diffs (no +/-, no @@ hunk headers, no line counts, no screenshots).
- Short code snippets are allowed only to clarify a fix. Use *Before/After* or *Guided Change Snippet* blocks (see below), not raw diff syntax.

## Required Heading Structure

# Code Review Report

## 1. Changed File Paths
Bulleted list of paths only (no line counts or diffs). Group by module/package when helpful.
- \`path/to/fileA.ts\` — modified
- \`services/user/\` — multiple files updated
- \`pkg/auth/index.ts\` — renamed from \`pkg/auth/main.ts\`
*If very large, include the most important 10–15, then “... and N more”.*

## 2. Summary of Changes (<=100 words)
One short paragraph describing what the MR/PR does at a high level. Do not enumerate every file or show diffs.

## 3. Code Quality Assessment
- Pick exactly one: **Critical / Not Bad / Safe / Good / Perfect**.  
- Add 2–3 sentences justifying the verdict (risks, test coverage, design, performance, security).
- Limit to 20 words.

## 4. Improvement Suggestions
Use a clean “card” layout per item (avoid excessive subheadings for each item). Prefer **bold labels** inside bullets for readability.  
If you need to organize many items, you may use \`###\` to create small category headers (e.g., “### Security”, “### Performance”). Do **not** use \`###\` for every single item.

- **File & Location**: \`path/to/file.ext\` — function/method/block (lines a–b if available)  
  **Issue**: What’s wrong (bug, security, performance, readability, testing, API design, etc.).  
  **Why it matters**: Impact on correctness, maintainability, user impact, scalability, etc.  
  **Actionable fix**: Concrete, step-by-step remediation.

  *Optional — Minimal Illustrative Change (when helpful)*  
  *Before*:
  \`\`\`<lang>
  // ≤10 lines focusing only on the relevant part…
  \`\`\`
  *After*:
  \`\`\`<lang>
  // ≤10 lines showing the improved approach…
  \`\`\`

  *Optional — Guided Change Snippet (direct "how to fix")*  
  Provide a single code block (≤15 lines) with the final intended version or pseudocode (no diff markers):  
  \`\`\`<lang>
  // Goal: enforce non-empty password before hashing
  function login(req, res) {
    const pw = req.body?.password;
    if (!pw) return res.status(401).end();
    const ok = hasher.compare(pw, user.hash);
    return ok ? res.json(user) : res.status(401).end();
  }
  \`\`\`

## Notes
- Do not include raw change hunks or diff markers in any section.
- Be concise and specific. Point to exact files/locations; avoid vague statements.
- Prioritize critical issues first; then improvements.
- Maintain a constructive tone and propose solutions, not just problems.

## Good Example (Improvement card)
- **File & Location**: \`api/user/UserController.ts\` — \`login()\` (42–60)  
  **Issue**: Null password can bypass comparison.  
  **Why it matters**: Authentication bypass risk.  
  **Actionable fix**: Validate null/empty before hashing; return 401 early.  
  *Before*:
  \`\`\`ts
  const ok = hasher.compare(req.body.password, user.hash)
  if (ok) return success(user)
  \`\`\`
  *After*:
  \`\`\`ts
  if (!req.body.password) return unauthorized()
  const ok = hasher.compare(req.body.password, user.hash)
  if (ok) return success(user)
  \`\`\`
  *Guided Change Snippet*:
  \`\`\`ts
  export function login(req, res) {
    const pw = req.body?.password;
    if (!pw) return res.status(401).end();
    const ok = hasher.compare(pw, user.hash);
    return ok ? res.json(user) : res.status(401).end();
  }
  \`\`\``;
