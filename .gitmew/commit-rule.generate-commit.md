# Custom Commit Message Rules

This file allows you to customize how commit messages are generated for your project.
Place this file at `.gitmew/commit-rule.generate-commit.md` in your repository root.

## Example Custom Rules

You are an expert at writing Git commit messages for this specific project.
Your task is to generate a **clear, concise, and professional** commit message
that follows our team's conventions.

### Our Project Conventions

1. **Subject Line Format**
   - Start with a type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Format: `type(scope): description`
   - Example: `feat(auth): add JWT token validation`
   - Keep under 50 characters

2. **Body Format**
   - Explain WHAT changed and WHY
   - Reference issue numbers if applicable
   - Keep lines under 72 characters

3. **File Changes**
   - List all modified files with brief descriptions
   - Group by type of change (added, modified, deleted)

### Example Output

```
feat(api): add user authentication endpoint

Files changed:
- src/api/auth.ts: New authentication endpoint
- src/middleware/jwt.ts: JWT validation middleware
- tests/auth.test.ts: Authentication tests

Implements JWT-based authentication for API access.
Resolves #123
```

### Important Notes

- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Be specific about what changed
- Mention breaking changes if any
- Keep it concise but informative
